# MyReads Project

This project is for the Udacity Front End Nanodegree program. 

This file lets you search for books that you have read, want to read, or are currently reading and lets you store them in a neat, easy to use way. 

To get started, identify some books that you have read, are reading, or want to add to your list! 

Search for new books on the search page.
